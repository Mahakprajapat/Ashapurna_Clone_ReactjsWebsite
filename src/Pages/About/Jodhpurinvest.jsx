            <p>Jodhpur or the Blue City of India is the second largest city of Rajasthan. The city was founded by Rao Jodha, a chief of the famous Rathore clan, way back in 1459. The city was earlier known as Marwar which later has been changed to Jodhpur to honour its founder Rao Jodha. Jodhpur is divided into two main areas- the old city and the new city.The old city is separated from the main city by a 10 km long wall that surrounds its boundary. There are eight gates to enter and exit the old city which is majorly a tourist attraction with some iconic hotspots within its parameters while the new city is a modern metropolis that surrounds the old city and houses all major developments of Jodhpur.</p>
